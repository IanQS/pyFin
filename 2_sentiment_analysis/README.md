# Roadmap

## Scraper:
1. register for an API key with [newsapi](https://newsapi.org/)

2. Create a new file called api_key.txt and add your key to it as the first line. The code will read from it

## Natural language processing

1. Read up the excellent [NLTK book](http://www.nltk.org/book/)

2. Read up [Spacy](https://spacy.io/usage/) which seems to be NLTK but with bonus things built into it

3. Read up PyTorch and the excellent natural language innovations that are coming out
