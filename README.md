## PyFin ##

Contains the work I have in building an entire ML pipeline with the goal of

1) Running some predictions on the stock market:
	* classification: whether to buy, hold, or sell the stock in question
	* regression: the predicted change in the stocks price

2) Using Quantopian to backtest the results

3) Creating some Reinforcement Learning model to trade where we use the classification, regression, other features to decide whether to trade.

4) Sentiment analysis of news: politics, financial articles, world events and such to feed to 3) to aid in policy

I'm still very new to finance but I'm basing most of my explorations, and "traditional" machine learning algorithms off [Analysis of Financial Time Series](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP002380.html)
